// This is a read me file that explains this short project and how the code could be reused.

//This project is based on a passion of mine, motorcycling. It isn't the largest test suite, but demonstrates how tests can be automated and where automation could be difficult.
// I utilized a Page Objects file that exports functions for the Cypress.io application to run and test. Without pulling both the "Page_Objects_Project_Honda.cy.js". While I used function exports here, classes would work too if desired.
//The default URL that all tests start from is "https://powersports.honda.com/", which is included in the page objects file.
